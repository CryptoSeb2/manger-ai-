You are being managed by Manager AI. Execute this goal in full:

**Goal / instruction:**
Build a tiny landing page and post one tweet

**Stack preference:** web

Do the following in order:
1. Understand the goal and break it into concrete tasks if needed.
2. Create or use this workspace — scaffold the project if nothing exists yet.
3. Implement each part of the goal (features, refactors, pages, deploy, etc.).
4. Add a README with run/deploy instructions and keep code clean and secure.

Reply when done and say what you built or changed. If the goal is large, work through it step by step; the user can run Manager AI again for "next steps" or follow-up commands.
